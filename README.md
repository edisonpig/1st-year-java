<h1>Java CourseWork in Brunel</h1>

This is my work with Java during my first year in Brunel University London studying computer science.<br><br>
This repository consists of a GUI-made Connect four game with simple algorithms creating the grids and columns for the game board, as well as the blue and red players. <br>
Most importantly, a strong AI opponent is written ( it was to challenge the lecturer that time when he said he can win any student playing this game)<br><br>

A simple decimal-converting calculator and some assignments for the course is also in this repository as a record of my studies.
